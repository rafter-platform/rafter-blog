Great question! I'll answer in a few different ways.

## üî• The TL;DR Description

Rafter is a **serverless deployment platform** powered by Google Cloud Run. It supports popular full-stack frameworks like Laravel, Rails, WordPress and more.

The **serverless** part means you don't have to worry about servers. It's container-based, but you don't even need to worry about Docker! Rafter acts as an abstraction layer over those details.

For developers, this means:

- Connect an existing GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository and deploy instantly.
- Or type `rafter deploy` to push a project from the command line.
- Your project scales to 0, meaning you're not paying for resources not being used.
- You own the entire stack: it lives in your Google Cloud account, so you can walk away from Rafter whenever you want.
- **You can focus on building your product instead of your infrastructure**.

## üë®‚Äçüíª The Technical Description

Rafter projects are created with several entrypoints in mind:

- Source control providers (GitHub, Gitlab, etc)
- Command line pushes (manually typing `rafter deploy`)

When a new input is received, Rafter kicks off a chain of jobs to:

1. **Create a Docker image using Google Cloud Build**. Rafter uses the type of your project (Rails, Laravel, Node) to provide a basic `Dockerfile` to use (`php` for Laravel, `ruby` for Rails), meaning you don't have to provide your own.
1. **Deploy to Google Cloud Run**. Rafter uses the image to create new `web` and `worker` services in Cloud Run.
1. **Inject Environment Variables**. Using a handy Secrets and Variables Management UI, Rafter injects the required environment variables into your application.
1. **Provision and Manage a Database**. If requested, Rafter creates a Cloud SQL database, connects it to your Cloud Run services, and injects the correct variables.
1. **Manage Queues**: Rafter creates a new queue in Cloud Tasks for your service, and provides first-class integrations into your framework to integrate queue workers in a serverless environment.
1. **Schedule Cloud Jobs**: Rafter uses Cloud Scheduler to ping your service using first-class framework integrations to run scheduled jobs.
1. **Run Commands**: Using PubSub, Rafter integrates with your framework to run CLI commands (think: `rails` or `artisan`).
1. **Provide Logs**: Rafter provides a UI to inspect the logs from your application as well as other metrics.

## Other Descriptions

- Rafter is like [Heroku](https://heroku.com), except you own the stack. Heroku uses AWS behind the scenes, but you pay for their services at a markup from AWS base costs. With Rafter, you pay Google Cloud for whatever costs you incur.
- Rafter is like [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com), but for Google Cloud ‚Äî¬†and it supports multiple frameworks and languages instead of just PHP and Laravel.
- Rafter is a wrapper around [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). You can totally do everything Rafter does manually, except you need to know Docker, Cloud Run APIs, configuration management, and more.
- Rafter is like Google App Engine, only it supports additional runtimes (anything that will fit in a Docker container).
- Rafter is Kuberetes, only several abstractions removed (Rafter ¬ª Cloud Run ¬ª Knative ¬ª Kubernetes).

I'm hoping to put together an even consider definition in the future. Stay tuned!
