**[I'm building a project called Rafter](https://github.com/jplhomer/rafter)**.

It's a serverless hosting platform, powered by Google Cloud. It's catered to full-stack frameworks like Laravel, Rails, and WordPress â€”Â but it can host _anything_ that fits in a container.

I plan to write a lot about the technical aspects of this service. But first, I wanted to step back and talk about _why_ I'm building this at all.

In February 2019, I wrote a blog post called [My Dream Side Project](https://creative.jplhomer.org/009-my-dream-side-project/).

In it, I expressed my desire for a **serverless hosting solution for PHP**, among other things. I went into detail about how [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Knative](https://knative.dev/) set the stage to make this possible.

But a lot has happened since then.

In April 2019, Google announced [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/announcing-cloud-run-the-newest-member-of-our-serverless-compute-stack), their container-based serverless platform built on Knative.

And in July 2019, Taylor Otwell introduced [Laravel Vapor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsPeWjKAUt0), which is the exact type of serverless platform for Laravel PHP apps hosted on AWS.

Seems like I'm not the only one who wanted this sort of thing to exist!

## Lots of thinking

Since I wrote that blog post more than a year ago, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

Thinking while mowing the lawn
...while vacuuming the house
...while walking the dogs
...while lying in bed.

While I tend to get down on myself when I haven't [actively created something](https://creative.jplhomer.org/011-creativity-consumption/), I need to give myself more credit: I've been putting a lot of time into thinking about solutions for this problem!

But up to the beginning of this year, I hadn't sat down to _create_ anything out of that thinking.

That all changed in January 2020.

## Building the thing

Fueled by a new sense of focus in a sleep-deprived state, I started building Rafter right when I became a new dad. This is a silly idea â€”Â I wouldn't recommend all new software projects start this way. But I enjoyed being able to knock out 20 minutes of writing code and then switching back to dad mode.

Feeding my son a bottle or rocking him to sleep gave me just enough time to think about my next coding move. And had I not been pressed for time, I probably wouldn't have been as productive.

The project is [open-source](https://github.com/jplhomer/rafter) right now. It's built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), with help from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). _No JavaScript framework like React or Vue yet_. ðŸ˜±

The actual app is not yet in a working state, nor is it ready for alpha/beta testers. _Soon_ though, I hope.

Hope you enjoy the ride as much as I do!
