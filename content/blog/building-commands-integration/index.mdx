This is heavily inspired by [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com), where you can fire off a command to a worker service. It hooks into framework-specific CLI utilities like `php artisan` for Laravel, `rails` for Rails, and `wp` for WordPress.

### April 28, 2020

- Decided that Rafter will expose a **Commands** UI that allows a user to create a new `Command` model, which is then dispatched via HTTP to the worker service
- Did lots of research on how to properly authenticate the request to the non-public worker service. If you're using a GCP service like Cloud Tasks or PubSub, it's super easy because Google handles authenticating with the receiving service just fine. However, we need to call this synchronous request ourselves and consume the response to display it to the user. This means we need to [sign the request ourselves with an OIDC token](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/service-to-service).
- Found a [useful code snippet](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto#authenticating_from_a_service_account) in the GCP docs for their IAP service (which we aren't actually using). But it demonstrates how you can leverage the Google-provided `ApplicationDefaultCredentials` class to take care of all the messy JWT signing. All you have to do is pass an `audience` parameter (which, in this case, is the URL of the worker Cloud Run service), and you get an OIDC token ‚ú®.

Let's start with the **Laravel Rafter Core** integration, since that's the easiest. In the service provider for the Laravel package, I [register the worker-specific routes](https://github.com/rafter-platform/laravel-rafter-core/blob/594cadcec5891114cbe905208a350a0b68d1e332/src/RafterServiceProvider.php#L59-L62):

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => [VerifyGoogleOidcToken::class, EnsureRafterWorker::class]], function () {
    Route::post(Rafter::QUEUE_ROUTE, 'Rafter\Http\Controllers\RafterQueueWorkerController');
    Route::post(Rafter::SCHEDULE_ROUTE, 'Rafter\Http\Controllers\RafterScheduleRunController');
});
```

- The `VerifyGoogleOidcToken` middleware is custom-built to verify an incoming request contains the proper Authorization header....
- And now that I type all of this out, I realize this probably isn't even necessary üôà since Google Cloud Run already authenticates the request. D'oh.

Anyway, carrying on. I'm adding a new route to the `Rafter` class:

```php{5}
class Rafter
{
    const QUEUE_ROUTE = '/_rafter/queue/work';
    const SCHEDULE_ROUTE = '/_rafter/schedule/run';
    const COMMAND_ROUTE = '/_rafter/command/run';
```

As well as a new route in the service provider, pointing to a new `RafterCommandRunController`:

```php
namespace Rafter\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;

class RafterCommandRunController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        Artisan::call($request->command);
        return Artisan::output();
    }
}
```

It's pretty straightforward:

- It uses the `Artisan` Facade to call a given command that is passed in through a request parameter
- Then it returns the output of the command, also using the `Artisan` facade.

Time to test this baby out! I have a [Rafter Laravel Example](https://github.com/rafter-platform/rafter-example-laravel) project locally that I'll use.

- First, I'll borrow [Caleb Porzio's `composer-link` bash alias](https://calebporzio.com/bash-alias-composer-link-use-local-folders-as-composer-dependancies/) to mount the local package into the project:

```bash
composer-link ../laravel-rafter-core
```

- **Update**: This didn't work üôÉ because I'm already referencing a package published on Packagist.
- Instead, I had to add the git repository and reference `dev-{branch}` e.g. `dev-commands` as the version name, and then run `composer update`. Thanks to [this blog post](https://lornajane.net/posts/2014/use-a-github-branch-as-a-composer-dependency)!

And my curl test worked great üéâ:

```bash
curl -d '{"command": "list"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://rafter-example-laravel.test/_rafter/command/run
Laravel Framework 7.9.2

Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

Options:
  -h, --help            Display this help message
  -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
  -V, --version         Display this application version
      --ansi            Force ANSI output
      --no-ansi         Disable ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
      --env[=ENV]       The environment the command should run under
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Available commands:
  clear-compiled       Remove the compiled class file
  ...
```

[‚ö°Ô∏è I've opened a PR for the Laravel Core Package here](https://github.com/rafter-platform/laravel-rafter-core/pull/1).

Next, let's focus on the **Rafter integration**. This will be a little more work:
